    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# flatten4d

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Flatten a four-dimensional nested array.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import flatten4d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-flatten4d@deno/mod.js';
```

You can also import the following named exports from the package:

```javascript
import { assign } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-flatten4d@deno/mod.js';
```

#### flatten4d( x, shape, colexicographic )

Flattens a four-dimensional nested array.

```javascript
var x = [ [ [ [ 1, 2 ] ] ], [ [ [ 3, 4 ] ] ] ];

var out = flatten4d( x, [ 2, 1, 1, 2 ], false );
// returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

To flatten in colexicographic order, provide a third argument equal to `true`.

```javascript
var x = [ [ [ [ 1, 2 ] ] ], [ [ [ 3, 4 ] ] ] ];

var out = flatten4d( x, [ 2, 1, 1, 2 ], true );
// returns [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]
```

#### flatten4d.assign( x, shape, colexicographic, out, stride, offset )

Flattens a four-dimensional nested array and assigns elements to a provided output array.

```javascript
import Float64Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-float64@deno/mod.js';

var x = [ [ [ [ 1, 2 ] ] ], [ [ [ 3, 4 ] ] ] ];
var out = new Float64Array( 4 );

var y = flatten4d.assign( x, [ 2, 1, 1, 2 ], false, out, 1, 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

var bool = ( y === out );
// returns true

y = flatten4d.assign( x, [ 2, 1, 1, 2 ], true, out, 1, 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   Both functions assume that all nested arrays have the same length (i.e., the input array is **not** a ragged array).

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import flatten4d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-flatten4d@deno/mod.js';

// Define a 2x2x2x2 array:
var x = [
    [
        [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ],
        [ [ 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8 ] ]
    ],
    [
        [ [ 9, 10 ], [ 11, 12 ] ],
        [ [ 13, 14 ], [ 15, 16 ] ]
    ]
];

var out = flatten4d( x, [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], false );
// returns []

out = flatten4d( x, [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], true );
// returns []

out = flatten4d( x, [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ], false );
// returns [ 1 ]

out = flatten4d( x, [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ], true );
// returns [ 1 ]

out = flatten4d( x, [ 1, 2, 2, 2 ], false );
// returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]

out = flatten4d( x, [ 1, 2, 2, 2 ], true );
// returns [ 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 8 ]

out = flatten4d( x, [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ], false );
// returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 ]

out = flatten4d( x, [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ], true );
// returns [ 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15, 2, 10, 6, 14, 4, 12, 8, 16 ]
